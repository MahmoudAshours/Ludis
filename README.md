## Getting Started

Ludis is a flutter IOS / Andorid /Web application which demonstrates the use of [Newton's Remarkable Cradle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNYS1ZhTJRA) which based on physical interactions and collisions.


# Tasks

- [x] Building the project strucutre.
- [x] Revision on Newton's Cradle.
- [ ] Draggability of first and last ball.
- [ ] Collision between first ball and the other balls.
- [ ] Collision between last ball and the other balls. 
- [ ] Achieving the conservation of Kineteic energy. **K.E = 1/2 * mass * velocity** .
- [ ] Acheiving the conservation of momentum. **Momentum = Velocity * mass **.
- [ ] Figuring out calculations of velocity of the ball.
- [ ] Adding animations to collision of balls. 
- [ ] Adding UI properties to the balls.
- [ ] Adding the ability to change color & mass of the balls.
- [ ] Adding timer for each cradle trial.


## What is Newton's cradle ?

Newton's cradle is a device that demonstrates conservation of momentum and energy using a series of swinging spheres. When one sphere at the end is lifted and released, it strikes the stationary spheres, transmitting a force through the stationary spheres that pushes the last sphere upward. The last sphere swings back and strikes the still nearly stationary spheres, repeating the effect in the opposite direction. The device is named after 17th-century English scientist Sir Isaac Newton. It is also known as Newton's pendulum, Newton's balls, Newton's rocker or executive ball clicker (since the device makes a click each time the balls collide, which they do repeatedly in a steady rhythm).
